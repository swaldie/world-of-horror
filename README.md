# World of Horror events

I've been playing a **lot** of [World of Horror](https://www.wohgame.com/) lately. So much so that I have, for the first time in my life, decided I want to get into modding. Here's a collection of events I've created.

I've also written up a little more detail on how to modify these event files to emulate certain things you encounter in game.  The event system seems to be pretty robust, and looks like what the dev uses to publish their own events.  Hopefully the tutorial.md file is useful to folks exploring this system on their own.
